# Mini RP2350 board for Digital Video

The RP2350's HSTX peripheral supports TMDS encoding, as needed for HDMI/DVI video.

The idea of this board is to provide a minimal board in a similar form factor to the Pico 2, but with an HDMI connector on it, to allow experimenting with HSTX and digital video.
